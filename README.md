# movie-app


An interactive Movie Search Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can search for movies through a public API (API key removed for security), browse results, and view detailed overviews by hovering over movie posters. This project demonstrates secure API integration, dynamic DOM manipulation, and responsive UI design.
